# Welcome to Chicken Invaders: Heba Edition
# To move press 'A' and 'D'
# Press 'Space' to shoot
# Be wary of the enemies becoming sentient 
#
# Oh Heba
# When I’m with you the world fades away
# Time escapes me
# Location alludes me
# Even the dimensions of this universe fall apart
# As all I can observe are your pretty curves 
# All I know is where you are 
# All I know is when we’re together
# And that you are my world
